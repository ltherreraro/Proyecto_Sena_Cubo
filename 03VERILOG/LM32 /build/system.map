WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   cam/cm/GND_3_o_GND_3_o_MUX_8_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <href_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
